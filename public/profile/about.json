    "about": "I’m a proud McMaster University alumni, with a degree in Software and Biomedical Engineering (iBioMed). My journey into software development started with one simple realization: the code can be a canvas, and there are no limits to what you can create. I’ve always loved using innovative software, so it only made sense to start building some for others to enjoy. On the biomedical side, engineering allows me to put my creativity to good use, designing devices that can make a real difference in people’s lives. The combination of these two fields has been the perfect way for me to blend my love for tech and my desire to help others. \n\nAlong the way, I had the privilege of interning at Honeywell as well as Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, where I expanded my skill set (and my coffee addiction). From honing soft skills like collaboration and communication to diving deep into software design, data structures, and algorithms, these experiences have shaped the developer I am today. And who knows, maybe I’m secretly designing the next big thing—just waiting for the right bug fix!",
