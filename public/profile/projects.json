My group and I were tasked to come up with a new machine learning segmentation model that outperforms the current gold standard models that are MedSAM, SAM, and SAMMed2D when it comes to Head and Neck cancers.\n\nAfter various design iterations, numerous trained models, and many many more UI wireframes, SegSlicer was created. SegSlicer is a solution for PET-CT image segmentation, benchmarking, and tumor volume reconstruction that can aid with Head and Neck cancer diagnosis as well as treatment.",

The device is mounted onto socks that are worn by the atheletes as they perform the hop test, a terminal rehabilitation stage test for patients who undergo ACL reconstruction surgery.\n\nUsing an accelorometer, a gyroscope, and force sensors the LSI is calculated and sent to the user's phone over Bluetooth. SA(c)LT also provides its user with progression indications along the rehabilitation journey.",
